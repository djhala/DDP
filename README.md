Applied Machine Learning Project

This repository is a class project on machine learning. The goal of the project was to tune the data required to correctly predict what activity is taking place in the pml-test csv file.

If you're the grader, try the "md" file instead of the "html" file if you have to download the html to your computer for some reason. The writeup.md file should read just fine in browser from github.
